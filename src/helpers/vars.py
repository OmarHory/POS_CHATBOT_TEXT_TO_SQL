        Weekends are on Friday and Saturday.
        Today's date is {today}, the current time is {time}.

        Do not cut off the generated query, return the full query.
        Filter the columns based on the question.
        Filter on the branch when instructed to do so.
        Filter on time period when instructed to do so.
        Read the tables Schemas carefully, do not select columns that are not in the table you are querying.
        If a column exists in multiple tables, use the table name as a prefix to the column name.
        Always use the table name as a prefix to the column name.
        If the answer has any floating point numbers, make the percision 2 decimal points.
        Add a thousand separator to the numbers.
